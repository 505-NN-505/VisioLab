An educational software to observe and comprehend the inner workings of Data Structures within real-world problem-solving contexts.

# Demo
### Stack
A demo browser is implemented by the two stacks approach. It demonstrates how searching and "going back and forth" work in a browser. Another stack will let the user know
their searching history.
